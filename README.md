# AR-project1
This Augmented Reality Project uses Unity and Vuforia to create a 3D scene around the image of a bookcover. The book used is Gods and Heroes of Ancient Greece. When a camera is pointed at that book cover, it recognizes it as the image target and generates several 3D objects around the scene, including the Trojan Horse, a chariot, a soldier fighting medusa, a temple, and a torch with a fire-y particle effect. It also has floating text reiterating the book's title and author. There is also a "Preview" button which you can press in AR to cause another figure to pop up and tell you about the book. In the background of the whole scene there is ambient music.
